# test_bootcamp_final
Final for NYU Data Bootcamp
Welcome to my final project, where I take a closer look at what really affects how students perform in school. Using a dataset of 1,000 students, I explored a mix of academic habits and lifestyle choices like how much students study or sleep, their mental health, how often they’re on social media, whether they have a part-time job, and more. I built a few different predictive models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to see which factors best predict exam scores. But more than just modeling, this project is about understanding the real behaviors and challenges that shape student success. I hope as you explore the notebooks and test out the Streamlit app, you’ll get a deeper sense of how things like consistency, well-being, and access to resources all come together to impact performance. Thanks for checking it out—I’m excited to share this journey with you.
